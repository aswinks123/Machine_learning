In social media platforms, we can see various kinds of advertisements with respect to users'
perspectives over the internet. Our model represents the analysis of user purchases over social
media from advertisements. The dataset lists customer’s ages, salaries, and whether
advertisements persuaded them to make a purchase. We have two features and a target variable
that processes and analysis using Random Forest classification logic. We tested, trained, and
visualized the data from the desired dataset. In this project, we have introduced a user interface
to automate the entire process which enhanced the implementation in the Jupiter notebook

Random Forest is another "Tree"-based algorithm that makes decisions by combining the
qualities of multiple Decision Trees. As a result, it can be described as a "forest" of trees; thus,
the name "Random Forest" exists. In this implementation, we use a Social Network
Advertisement dataset as part of the Random Forest Classification model. Our dataset consists
of three columns in total. The first two columns are the independent variables, such as ‘Age’
and ‘Estimated Salary,’ followed by the last column, which is the dependent column,
‘Purchased,’ which is represented in binary format. The ‘Purchased’ column represents
whether the customer or user made a purchase (1) or not (0). Using this data, we must develop
a Classifier for a specific product that predicts whether an individual of a specific age and
earning a certain salary will purchase a product promoted on a social media platform.
